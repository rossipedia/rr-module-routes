# React Router DOM Tutorial

This was built by following the [React Router 6 Tutorial](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/start/tutorial) and adapted to use the `createModuleRoutes()` from [this PR](https://github.com/remix-run/react-router/pull/9830).

## Getting Started

Clone this repo, and run `npm install`

This project is based on `vite`, so to kick things off, run `npx vite` from the project root.
